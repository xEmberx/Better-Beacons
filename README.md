# Better Beacons

Have you ever asked yourself what the point of using better materials than iron or gold in a beacon is? Sure, you may say simply for style points, but what if you could get more? Meet Better Beacons, a mod which aims to improve the way beacons work.

Hypothetically, lets say you have a Beacon and a mixture of material blocks. This mixture consists of 64 Iron Blocks, 35 Gold Blocks, 45 Emerald Blocks, 15 Diamond Blocks, and 5 Netherite Blocks. You begin building your beacon base with these materials, in no particular order, and finally place your Beacon atop it. You select your effect from the UI and find out you have a range of 95 blocks, almost double the standard!

This mod changes Beacons to use a "point system" approach to it's radius depending on the Beacon's pyramid\
From worst to best material: Iron -> Gold -> Emerald -> Diamond -> Netherite

A level 4 Beacon with a pyramid consisting entirely of:\
Iron Blocks will be equivalent to that of a standard level 4 Beacon (50 blocks)\
Gold Blocks will have a radius of 85 blocks\
Emerald Blocks will have a radius of 120 blocks\
Diamond Blocks will have a radius of 185 blocks\
Netherite Blocks will have a radius of 250 blocks
